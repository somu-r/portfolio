        <h4><p> Optimizing Wastewater Treatment Through Artificial Intelligence</p></h4>
    <li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being applied in wastewater treatment for process optimization
 which involves the use of AI algorithms for the real-time analysis of data from sensors to optimize the
 various stages of wastewater treatment.</li> <br>
    <li>includes monitoring parameters such as pH, and DO levels, turbidity, tds, and temperature. This
 includes detecting unusual variations in water quality parameters that may indicate system malfunctions or
 the presence of pollutants.</li>  <br>
    <li>The purpose of this work was to use machine learning techniques such as SVM, RF and XG Boost method
 to categorize a dataset of water quality. Water quality is dictated by features such as dissolved oxygen (DO),
 temperature, pH, Turbidity and Total Dissolved Sensor(TGS).</li> <br>
    <li>These features are handled in five steps: data pre-processing using min-max normalization and missing data
 management using RF, feature correlation, applied machine learning classification, and models feature
 importance.</li><br>
